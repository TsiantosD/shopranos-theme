# Shopranos hackathon

## Development

#### VS Code plugin
To start working on the theme, go to VS Code > Extensions and download the [Shopranos extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopranos.shopranos). Login to your Shopranos account and select a company.

> Note: each team should work on one Shopranos account. Only one person from each team will submit the theme.

Then start working on the theme. Hitting `Ctrl` + `S` will save the file and send it to Shoprano's staging evironment.

#### Stage
The staging environment can be accessed by appending the query parameter `?env=staging` at the end of each eshop's URL. For example:

https://trial-2447.shopranos.eu/product/nike-running-react-pegasus-trail-4-gore-tex-trainers?env=staging

#### Publishing
To publish the changes to the production eshop, go to [Shopranos Dashboard](https://platform.shopranos.eu/) > Online Store > Theme Configurator and click the "Publish" button.
